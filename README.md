# learn_python3_the_hard_way
My Exercises from Learn Python 3 The Hard Way by Zed A. Shaw https://learnpythonthehardway.org/

File name convention:
ex+number.py = exercise + exercise number

ex+number.py = original code from book
<filename>d = my documented code
<filename>t+number = task + task number (in Zed A. Shaw book)
<filename>t+number+version = task + task number + version (if I created various trials and versions of the file)

'brokeit' = a file version where someone else broke my code on purpose for my to fix it.
